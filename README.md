### Installation:
Download it through the Repository in Stand, this way it should auto-update. Alternatively, you can drop LAZScript.lua into the Lua Scripts folder.

### Remarks
I don't play regularly anymore, therefore I might not spot new bugs. If there is a problem with the script, feel free to open a ticket here on Github or reach out on Discord [@LAZ13](https://discordapp.com/users/137670410677256192/).
